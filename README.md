# 30 Days of Tailwind CSS

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge I decided to tackle.  The goal?  Sharpen my front end layout & website design skills by completing 30 days (_although maybe not 30 days straight_) 
worth of building as close to pixel perfect as possbile designs as I can using Tailwind CSS.

## Project Breakdown

Each challenge is broken up by day and you can browse the code by by viewing a given day.  A README and a final completed design screenshot are included for all challenges.
