## Details
Build out a Coming Soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## Requirements
Your users should be able to: 
* View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
* See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
* Submit their email address using an `input` field
* Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  * The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
  * The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*
